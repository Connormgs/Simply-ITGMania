# Simply ITGMania 
*****READ THIS SHIT*****

Simply ITG for ITGMania with pretty much every feature of simply love and zmod including groovestats and boogiestats support. If you run into any problems or want things changed let me know. The theme is constantly being updated so if you run into bugs there's a chance they'll be fixed within a few days of you encountering them.

On fresh installs you might get a bug in the evaluation screen that says incorrect preferences/metrics on the QR code pane. To fix this switch to simply love, go to the evaluation screen then switch back to simply itgmania and that should resolve the issue.

Restart the game after picking your color for the background to properly change

Big thanks to hata, kit and defektive for testing the theme and identifying bugs for me to fix.

Big thanks to zarzob and zankoku for zmod and giving me even more awesome features to add to the theme.
