# Simply ITGMania 
Simply ITG for ITGMania. If you run into any problems or want things changed let me know. The theme is constantly being updated so if you run into bugs there's a chance they'll be fixed within a few days of you encountering them.

Restart the game after picking your color for the background to properly change
